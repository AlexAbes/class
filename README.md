# DLP Class

An online classroom management tool for [Digital Literacy Project](http://dlp.io)
teaching volunteers.

## Overview

DLP Class 2.0 will be an online classroom management tool for DLP teaching volunteers. During class, students and teachers will log into the web app, and then teachers will push arbitrary content modules (such as links, worksheets, and videos) to studentsâ€™ computer screens, thereby reducing time wasted by passing out worksheets, writing links on the board, trying to talk over students, etc. Teachers will be able to build a library of modules and share their modules with other teachers.
